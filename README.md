This repository is for showcasing my queries for the premium PostgreSQL questions from the platform Strata Scratch. I have a premium account to practice honing my SQL/PostgreSQL skills. <b>The queries are my own answers from the platform, and some queries may be different from the official answers</b>. What I learned from SQL is sometimes there is more than one way to solve a problem. 

Note: I did not include the company is which the questions are from but I have included the question ID from the platform. I have also limited the results to only 5 rows. 

This repository is formatted in SQL to highlight the queries.
